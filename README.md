# Final Project Python - 2017

## Nur Asiah
### Project Description:
This project is an image classification application for Pokémon images consisting of three classes: Grass, Fire, and Water. The project is developed with Django as a web-based application. The classification models used are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The performance of these two classifiers will be compared based on their accuracy to determine the best prediction results.

The application workflow is as follows: users upload a Pokémon image and click the submit button. After submission, the system performs image classification. The system then displays the predicted Pokémon type along with additional information related to the predicted class.

### Project Objectives:
The objectives of this project are:

1. To develop a web-based application capable of classifying Pokémon images into three types: Grass, Fire, and Water using Django.
2. To implement and apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) as image classification models.
3. To compare the performance of CNN and KNN based on classification accuracy.
4. To determine the most effective model for predicting Pokémon image classes.
5. To provide users with clear prediction results and relevant information about the identified Pokémon type through an easy-to-use interface.
